## Introduction SPARQL Event Processing Architecture
SEPA is a publish-subscribe architecture designed to support information level interoperability. The architecture is built on top of a generic SPARQL endpoint where publishers and subscribers use standard **SPARQL** Updates and Queries. Notifications about events (i.e., changes in the **RDF** knowledge base) are expressed in terms of added and removed SPARQL binding results since the previous notification. To know more about SEPA architecture and vision please refere to this [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/10/4/36/htm).

If you just cannot wait to try SEPA go to [SEPA Playground](http://mml.arces.unibo.it/apps/dashboard?mode=playground) and use Update and Subscribe tab with the example provided.

## Quick start

- Download the [SEPA Engine](https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPA/releases/latest) and run it: `java -jar engine-x.y.z.jar`

- Download [Blazegraph](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bigdata/files/latest/download) (or use any other SPARQL 1.1 Protocol compliant service) and run it as shown [here](https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_Start) 

- Use the [SEPA Playground](http://mml.arces.unibo.it/apps/dashboard?mode=local) to check basic functionalities of the engine.

### For Hackers 💻👩‍💻👨‍💻

## Configuration
The SEPA engine can be used with different SPARQL endpoints which must support SPARQL 1.1 protocol. The endpoint can be configured using
a JSON file `endpoint.jpar`. Furthermore, the engine has various parameters that can be used to configure the standard behavior; they
can be set using another JSON file called `engine.jpar`.  
In the repository, you will find some versions of `endpoint-{something}.jpar` file. According to your underlying SPARQL endpoint, you have to rename the correct file to `endpoint.jpar`.
The default version of `endpoint.jpar` configures the engine to use use a local running instance of Blazegraph as [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol Service](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/).

```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "sparql11protocol": {
    "protocol": "http",
    "port": 9999,
    "query": {
      "path": "/blazegraph/namespace/kb/sparql",
      "method": "POST",
      "format": "JSON"
    },
    "update": {
      "path": "/blazegraph/namespace/kb/sparql",
      "method": "POST",
      "format": "JSON"
    }
  },
  "sparql11seprotocol": {
    "protocol": "ws",
    "availableProtocols": {
      "ws": {
        "port": 9443,
        "path": "/subscribe"
      },
      "wss": {}
    }
  }
}
```
The default version of  `engine.jpar` configures the engine to listen for incoming [SPARQL 1.1 SE Protocol](http://wot.arces.unibo.it/TR/sparql11-se-protocol/) requests at the following URLs:

1. Query: http://localhost:8000/query
2. Update: http://localhost:8000/update
3. Subscribe/Unsubscribe: ws://localhost:9000/subscribe
4. SECURE Query: https://localhost:8443/secure/query
5. SECURE Update: https://localhost:8443/secure/update
6. SECURE Subscribe/Unsubscribe: wss://localhost:9443/secure/subscribe 
7. Regitration: https://localhost:8443/oauth/register
8. Token request: https://localhost:8443/oauth/token
```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "scheduler": {
      "queueSize": 100,
      "timeout": 5000
    },
    "processor": {
      "updateTimeout": 5000,
      "queryTimeout": 5000,
      "maxConcurrentRequests": 5,

    },

        "update": "/update",
        "query": "/query",
        "subscribe": "/subscribe",
        "unsubscribe": "/unsubscribe",
        "register": "/oauth/register",
        "tokenRequest": "/oauth/token"
      },
      "ports": {
        "http": 8000,
        "https": 8443,
        "ws": 9000,
        "wss": 9443
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Security

The engine uses a JKS for storing the keys and certificates for [SSL](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6ek/index.html) and [JWT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) signing/verification. A default `sepa.jks` is provided including a single X.509 certificate (the password for both the store and the key is: `sepa2017`). If you face problems using the provided JKS, please delete the `sepa.jks` file and create a new one as follows: `keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias sepakey -keystore sepa.jks -storepass sepa2017 -validity 360 -keysize 2048`

## Usage

The SEPA engine allows to use a user generated JKS. Run `java -jar engine-x.y.z.jar -help` for a list of options. The Java [Keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html) can be used to create, access and modify a JKS. 

The SEPA engine is also distributed with a default [JMX](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/javamanagement-140525.html) configuration `jmx.properties` (including the `jmxremote.password` and `jmxremote.access` files for password and user grants). Remember to change password file permissions using: `chmod 600 jmxremote.password`. To enable remote JMX, the engine must be run as follows: `java -Dcom.sun.management.config.file=jmx.properties -jar engine-x.y.z.jar`. Using [`jconsole`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html) is possible to monitor and control the most important engine parameters. By default, the port is `5555` and the `root:root` credentials grant full control (read/write).

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Check some IDE specific instruction below
4. Do your stuff
5. Provide tests for your features if applicable
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
6. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. Submit a pull request :D

Pull request with unit tests have an higher likelihood to be accepted, but we are not to restrictive. So do not be afraid to send your contribution!

### Clone in Eclipse
There is no particular restriction in your IDE choice, here we provide a short guide to import the cloned project inside Eclipse. Any 
other IDE should be fine. 

1. Open Eclipse
2. File > Import > Maven
3. Choose "Check out Maven Projects from SCM"
4. In the field SCM URL choose 'git' and add the clone address from Github. If 'git' is not found, tap into "Find more SCM connectors in the m2e Marketplace"
5. go on...
The project is cloned. Enjoy!

### Build with maven
SEPA engine is a maven project and you can build it with this command:
```bash
mvn install
```
That create an executable inside the target directory. To know more about mave please refer to the [official documentation](https://maven.apache.org/).


## History

SEPA has been inspired and influenced by [Smart-M3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smart-m3/). SEPA authors have been involved in the development of Smart-M3 since its [origin](https://artemis-ia.eu/project/4-sofia.html). 

The main differences beetween SEPA and Smart-M3 are the protocol (now compliant with the [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/)) and the introduction of a security layer (based on TLS and JSON Web Token for client authentication). 

All the SEPA software components have been implemented from scratch.
